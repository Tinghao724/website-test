**November 27** <br> Submit [Project Proposal + Data Report](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).

**December 21** Submit project.  <br> The absolute latest time a project can be submitted is **11:59pm December 21**.  No exceptions.  Keep in mind that this is the last possible time, not a target; you're more than welcome to submit your project earlier.  And honestly, you don't want this to drag on any longer than this. <br>

 **There is no final exam.** If NYU schedules an exam time, which they sometimes do, we still won't have one.
