## Advanced graphics with Plotly and Seaborn

**Handouts:**  Code ([Plotly](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Code/notebooks/bootcamp_plotly.ipynb) | [Seaborn ](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Code/notebooks/bootcamp_advgraphics_seaborn.ipynb))  <br>
**Summary:** We cover more advanced graphics using the seaborn and plotly packages. We show how to leverage our knowledge of matplotlib to jumpstart our usage of these two packages. We also show how seaborn can be used to easliy construct common, yet sophisticated graphics with little additional effort. We also show how to leverage plotly's unique features to do things that are very difficult, or sometimes impossible, to do with matplotlib.

## Web scraping

**Handouts:**  [Code](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Code/notebooks/bootcamp_scraping-sortof.ipynb)  <br>
**Summary:** Python has great tools for scraping data off websites. We will give a _very light_ introduction to some of the routines we've found useful for doing this.

The next three topics provide some structure for thinking about data.  *Distributions* is about the frequencies of various outcomes:  stock returns, incomes of individuals, medical expenses, movie grosses.  *Dependence* is about connections between two variables, a connection often summarized (incompletely) by their correlation.  *Dynamics* is about the relation between a variable at two different dates. Is strong economic growth followed by the same?  How do bond ratings evolve?

---
## Distributions

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br>
**Summary:**  Some data is usefully described not by (say) its mean or median, but by its range of outcomes.  Examples include equity returns, the age distribution of the population, size of firms, and incomes of individuals.  We describe distributions with histograms, smoothed histograms (kde's), and so on.  We introduce the Numpy package along the way and use ipywidgets in Jupyter to add interactivity to our code.

---
## Statistics & Machine Learning

**Handouts:**  Outline | Code  <br>
**Summary:**  These are whole subjects, not topics, but we thought a brief overview of their history would be useful.  We combine it an application to multivariate regression with two packages, StatsModels (statistics) and Scikit-Learn (machine learning).
