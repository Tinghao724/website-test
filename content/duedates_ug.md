[Spring Break, have fun]


<!--
**March 23** <br> Submit [Revised Project Ideas](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf). <br> (We're willing to let this slide till April 6.  The point is that you should start thinking about your project as soon as the exam is over.  But if you want to take another week to think about this, do it.)
-->

**April 6** <br> Submit [Project Proposal](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).

**April 20** Submit [Data Report](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).  This is really a little late; we urge you to think about data from the beginning. Ask for help if you're not sure you have what you need.

**May 12 (5pm)** <br> Submit your project to NYU Classes. The file name should be your last names separated by dashes and a short title;  eg, something like *Jones-Smith-Zhang-India.ipynb*. See [Project Guide](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf) for additional information.

This is the absolute latest time a project can be submitted.  No exceptions.  Keep in mind that this is the last possible time, not a target; you're more than welcome to submit your project earlier.  And honestly, you don't want this to drag on any longer.

 **There is no final exam.** If NYU schedules an exam time, which they sometimes do, we still won't have one.
